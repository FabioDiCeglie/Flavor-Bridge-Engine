        "name": "Miso",
        "description": "A traditional Japanese seasoning produced by fermenting soybeans with salt and kōji (Aspergillus oryzae). Extremely high in free glutamic acid, providing a powerful savory umami profile. Contains melanoidins from the Maillard reaction during aging, contributing deep, complex flavors with salty, funky, and slightly sweet notes."
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Parmesan (Parmigiano-Reggiano)",
        "description": "An aged Italian hard cheese made from raw cow's milk. Extended aging (12-36 months) breaks down proteins into free amino acids, particularly glutamic acid, creating intense umami. Contains tyrosine crystals and has nutty, sharp, and savory characteristics with a granular texture."
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Black Garlic",
        "description": "Garlic that has been aged through controlled heat and humidity for several weeks. The Maillard reaction produces melanoidins, giving it a dark color and complex flavor profile. Sweet, tangy, with notes of balsamic vinegar, molasses, and tamarind. Rich in antioxidants and has a soft, jelly-like texture."
    },
    {
        "id": 4,

        "description": "An aged Italian vinegar made from grape must. Years of barrel aging develop complex melanoidins through slow Maillard reactions. Sweet and sour with notes of fig, molasses, and cherry. The longer aged versions have syrupy consistency and intense concentration of flavors."
    },
    {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "Soy Sauce",
        "description": "A fermented condiment made from soybeans, wheat, salt, and water. Fermentation by Aspergillus molds and lactobacillus creates high levels of glutamic acid and other amino acids. Deep umami flavor with salty, slightly sweet notes and complex aromatic compounds from months of aging."
    },
    {
        "id": 6,
        "name": "Fish Sauce",

    {
        "id": 7,
        "name": "Anchovy",
        "description": "Small, oily fish typically preserved in salt or oil. High in glutamic acid and inosinic acid, providing synergistic umami. Intense savory, briny flavor that dissolves into dishes adding depth without fishiness. The salt-curing process concentrates amino acids and develops complex flavors."

    {
        "id": 8,
        "name": "Tomato (Ripe)",
        "description": "A fruit naturally high in glutamic acid, especially when ripe or cooked. Sun-dried or concentrated forms (paste) have even higher glutamate levels.

        "id": 9,
        "name": "Shiitake Mushroom",
        "description": "An edible mushroom native to East Asia. Contains high levels of guanylate (GMP), which synergizes with glutamate to multiply umami perception. Earthy, smoky, meaty flavor profile. Dried shiitake has concentrated umami compounds and adds depth to broths and sauces."

        "id": 10,
        "name": "Kombu (Kelp)",

    {
        "id": 11,
        "name": "Dark Chocolate",
        "description": "Chocolate with high cocoa content (70%+). Roasting cocoa beans triggers the Maillard reaction, creating hundreds of flavor compounds including melanoidins. Bitter, slightly acidic with notes of coffee, dried fruit, and earth. Contains theobromine and has complex fermented and roasted characteristics."

    {
        "id": 12,
        "name": "Coffee (Roasted)",
        "description": "Roasted seeds of the Coffea plant. The roasting process creates extensive Maillard reactions, producing melanoidins and hundreds of aromatic compounds. Bitter, acidic, with notes of caramel, chocolate, nuts, and fruit depending on origin and roast level."
